# in-class
These are the in-class files that I will be creating during my lectures. You can find the base files on the **master** branch and you can find the final version on the **demo** branch.

Fork my repo (click on the Fork icon in the upper right hand corner of this screen. 

This creates a copy of this repo in your own personal Gitbhub account space, and allows you to modify and make changes without impacting the main repo.

You can get updates from the main repo at any time by using `git pull upstream master`
